<p>
  The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
  descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from
  an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over 14,000 years ago. The dog was
  the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that
  hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was
  before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with
  humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and
  gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate
  for other canids.
